Welcome to EWF's Secret Store documentation!
********************************************

This is a python library for interacting with Parity's secret store.
It is an abstraction layer (API) on top of the official 
`secretstore module API <https://wiki.parity.io/JSONRPC-secretstore-module>`_ and
`secretstore sessions <https://wiki.parity.io/Secret-Store>`_. 
Naming conventions follow the underlying APIs'.

This documentation is for this library and its functions. For more information on 
how Secret Store works, please refer to the `Parity wiki <https://github.com/paritytech/wiki>`_. 
Most of the function descriptions have been copied from there.
